This is a workspace as a simple way for collaboration.  
Please read the following rules carefully.

## Folder organization
- To start, create a folder corresponding to the (common) branch you are working on together.
- Then, if necessary, create subfolders for each member.

## File organization
- If multiple members need to change the same class or function file, make a copy in your own working subfolder. This way, you can make your changes without impacting your colleagues’ work.
- The original file can then be updated to a final version that merges all changes.
- After that, you can delete the version in your subfolder.

## Private files ⚠️
- Since all branches are public, if you have private files that you don’t want to share, name them `x__...` or `X__...` (with any extension).
